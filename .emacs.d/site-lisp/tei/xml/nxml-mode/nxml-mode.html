<h1>nXML Mode</h1>

<p>This manual documents nxml-mode, an Emacs major mode for editing
XML with RELAX NG support.  This manual is not yet complete.</p>

<section>
<h2>Completion</h2>

<p>Apart from real-time validation, the most important feature that
nxml-mode provides for assisting in document creation is "completion".
Completion assists the user in inserting characters at point, based on
knowledge of the schema and on the contents of the buffer before
point.</p>

<p>The traditional GNU Emacs key combination for completion in a
buffer is <tt>M-<key>TAB</key></tt>. However, many window systems
and window managers use this key combination themselves (typically for
switching between windows) and do not pass it to applications. It's
hard to find key combinations in GNU Emacs that are both easy to type
and not taken by something else.  <tt>C-<key>RET</key></tt> (i.e.
pressing the Enter or Return key, while the Ctrl key is held down) is
available.  It won't be available on a traditional terminal (because
it is indistinguishable from Return), but it will work with a window
system.  Therefore we adopt the following solution by default: use
<tt>C-<key>RET</key></tt> when there's a window system and
<tt>M-<key>TAB</key></tt> when there's not.  In the following, I
will assume that a window system is being used and will therefore
refer to <tt>C-<key>RET</key></tt>.</p>

<p>Completion works by examining the symbol preceding point.  This
is the symbol to be completed. The symbol to be completed may be the
empty. Completion considers what symbols starting with the symbol to
be completed would be valid replacements for the symbol to be
completed, given the schema and the contents of the buffer before
point.  These symbols are the possible completions.  An example may
make this clearer.  Suppose the buffer looks like this (where <point/>
indicates point):

<pre>
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
&lt;h<point/>
</pre>

and the schema is XHTML.  In this context, the symbol to be completed
is <bo>h</bo>.  The possible completions consist of just
<bo>head</bo>.  Another example, is

<pre>
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
&lt;head>
&lt;<point/>
</pre>

In this case, the symbol to be completed is empty, and the possible
completions are <bo>base</bo>, <bo>isindex</bo>,
<bo>link</bo>, <bo>meta</bo>, <bo>script</bo>,
<bo>style</bo>, <bo>title</bo>.  Another example is:

<pre>
&lt;html xmlns="<point/>
</pre>

In this case, the symbol to be completed is empty, and the possible
completions are just <bo>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</bo>.</p>

<p>When you type <tt>C-<key>RET</key></tt>, what happens depends
on what the set of possible completions are.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>If the set of completions is empty, nothing
happens.</p></li>

<li><p>If there is one possible completion, then that completion is
inserted, together with any following characters that are
required. For example, in this case:

<pre>
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
&lt;<point/>
</pre>

<tt>C-<key>RET</key></tt> will yield

<pre>
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
&lt;head<point/>
</pre>
</p>
</li>

<li><p>If there is more than one possible completion, but all
possible completions share a common non-empty prefix, then that prefix
is inserted. For example, suppose the buffer is:

<pre>
&lt;html x<point/>
</pre>

The symbol to be completed is <bo>x</bo>. The possible completions
are <bo>xmlns</bo> and <bo>xml:lang</bo>.  These share a
common prefix of <bo>xml</bo>.  Thus, <tt>C-<key>RET</key></tt>
will yield:

<pre>
&lt;html xml<point/>
</pre>

Typically, you would do <tt>C-<key>RET</key></tt> again, which would
have the result described in the next item.</p></li>

<li><p>If there is more than one possible completion, but the
possible completions do not share a non-empty prefix, then Emacs will
prompt you to input the symbol in the minibuffer, initializing the
minibuffer with the symbol to be completed, and popping up a buffer
showing the possible completions.  You can now input the symbol to be
inserted.  The symbol you input will be inserted in the buffer instead
of the symbol to be completed.  Emacs will then insert any required
characters after the symbol.  For example, if it contains:

<pre>
&lt;html xml<point/>
</pre>

Emacs will prompt you in the minibuffer with

<pre>
Attribute: xml<point/>
</pre>

and the buffer showing possible completions will contain

<pre>
Possible completions are:
xml:lang			   xmlns
</pre>

If you input <tt>xmlns</tt>, the result will be:

<pre>
&lt;html xmlns="<point/>
</pre>

(If you do <tt>C-<key>RET</key></tt> again, the namespace URI will
be inserted. Should that happen automatically?)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Inserting end-tags</h2>

<p>The main redundancy in XML syntax is end-tags.  nxml-mode provides
several ways to make it easier to enter end-tags.  You can use all of
these without a schema.</p>

<p>You can use <tt>C-<key>RET</key></tt> after <bo>&lt;/</bo>
to complete the rest of the end-tag.</p>

<p><tt>C-c C-f</tt> inserts an end-tag for the element containing
point. This command is useful when you want to input the start-tag,
then input the content and finally input the end-tag. The <bo>f</bo>
is mnemonic for finish.</p>

<p>If you want to keep tags balanced and input the end-tag at the
same time as the start-tag, before inputting the content, then you can
use <tt>C-c C-i</tt>. This inserts a <bo>&gt;</bo>, then inserts
the end-tag and leaves point before the end-tag.  <tt>C-c C-b</tt>
is similar but more convenient for block-level elements: it puts the
start-tag, point and the end-tag on successive lines, appropriately
indented. The <bo>i</bo> is mnemonic for inline and the
<bo>b</bo> is mnemonic for block.</p>

<p>Finally, you can customize nxml-mode so that <tt>/</tt>
automatically inserts the rest of the end-tag when it occurs after
<bo>&lt;</bo>, by doing

<display>
<tt>M-x customize-variable <key>RET</key> nxml-slash-auto-complete-flag <key>RET</key></tt>
</display>

and then following the instructions in the displayed buffer.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Paragraphs</h2>

<p>Emacs has several commands that operate on paragraphs, most
notably <tt>M-q</tt>. nXML mode redefines these to work in a way
that is useful for XML.  The exact rules that are used to find the
beginning and end of a paragraph are complicated; they are designed
mainly to ensure that <tt>M-q</tt> does the right thing.</p>

<p>A paragraph consists of one or more complete, consecutive lines.
A group of lines is not considered a paragraph unless it contains some
non-whitespace characters between tags or inside comments.  A blank
line separates paragraphs.  A single tag on a line by itself also
separates paragraphs.  More precisely, if one tag together with any
leading and trailing whitespace completely occupy one or more lines,
then those lines will not be included in any paragraph.</p>

<p>A start-tag at the beginning of the line (possibly indented) may
be treated as starting a paragraph.  Similarly, an end-tag at the end
of the line may be treated as ending a paragraph. The following rules
are used to determine whether such a tag is in fact treated as a
paragraph boundary:
<ul>
<li><p>If the schema does not allow text at that point, then it
is a paragraph boundary.</p></li>
<li><p>If the end-tag corresponding to the start-tag is not at
the end of its line, or the start-tag corresponding to the end-tag is
not at the beginning of its line, then it is not a paragraph
boundary. For example, in
<pre>
&lt;p>This is a paragraph with an
&lt;emph>emphasized&lt;/emph> phrase.
</pre>
the <bo>&lt;emph&gt;</bo> start-tag would not be considered as
starting a paragraph, because its corresponding end-tag is not at the
end of the line.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is text that is a sibling in element tree, then
it is not a paragraph boundary.  For example, in
<pre>
&lt;p>This is a paragraph with an
&lt;emph>emphasized phrase that takes one source line&lt;/emph>
</pre>
the <bo>&lt;emph&gt;</bo> start-tag would not be considered as
starting a paragraph, even though its end-tag is at the end of its
line, because there the text <bo>This is a paragraph with an</bo>
is a sibling of the <bo>emph</bo> element.</p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise, it is a paragraph boundary.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Locating a schema</h2>

<p>nXML mode has a configurable set of rules to locate a schema for
the file being edited.  The rules are contained in one or more schema
locating files, which are XML documents.</p>

<p>The variable <bo>rng-schema-locating-files</bo> specifies
the list of the file-names of schema locating files that nXML mode
should use.  The order of the list is significant: when file
<var>x</var> occurs in the list before file <var>y</var> then rules
from file <var>x</var> have precedence over rules from file
<var>y</var>.  A filename specified in
<bo>rng-schema-locating-files</bo> may be relative. If so, it will
be resolved relative to the document for which a schema is being
located. It is not an error if relative file-names in
<bo>rng-schema-locating-files</bo> do not not exist. You can use
<tt>M-x customize-variable <key>RET</key> rng-schema-locating-files
<key>RET</key></tt> to customize the list of schema locating
files.</p>

<p>By default, <bo>rng-schema-locating-files</bo> list has two
members: <bo>schemas.xml</bo>, and
<bo><var>dist-dir</var>/schema/schemas.xml</bo> where
<bo><var>dist-dir</var></bo> is the directory containing the nXML
distribution. The first member will cause nXML mode to use a file
<bo>schemas.xml</bo> in the same directory as the document being
edited if such a file exist.  The second member contains rules for the
schemas that are included with the nXML distribution.</p>

<section>
<h2>Commands for locating a schema</h2>

<p>The command <tt>C-c C-w</tt> will tell you what schema
is currently being used.</p>

<p>The rules for locating a schema are applied automatically when
you visit a file in nXML mode. However, if you have just created a new
file and the schema cannot be inferred from the file-name, then this
will not locate the right schema.  In this case, you should insert the
start-tag of the root element and then use the command <tt>C-c
C-a</tt>, which reapplies the rules based on the current content of
the document.  It is usually not necessary to insert the complete
start-tag; often just <bo>&lt;<var>name</var></bo> is
enough.</p>

<p>If you want to use a schema that has not yet been added to the
schema locating files, you can use the command <tt>C-c C-s</tt> to
manually select the schema for the document in current buffer.  Emacs
will read the file-name of the schema from the minibuffer. After
reading the file-name, Emacs will ask whether you wish to add a rule
to a schema locating file that persistently associates the document
with the selected schema.  The rule will be added to the first file in
the list specified <bo>rng-schema-locating-files</bo>; it will
create the file if necessary, but will not create a directory. If the
variable <bo>rng-schema-locating-files</bo> has not been
customized, this means that the rule will be added to the file
<bo>schemas.xml</bo> in the same directory as the document being
edited.</p>

<p>The command <tt>C-c C-t</tt> allows you to select a schema by
specifying an identifier for the type of the document.  The schema
locating files determine the available type identifiers and what
schema is used for each type identifier. This is useful when it is
impossible to infer the right schema from either the file-name or the
content of the document, even though the schema is already in the
schema locating file.  A situation in which this can occur is when
there are multiple variants of a schema where all valid documents have
the same document element.  For example, XHTML has Strict and
Transitional variants.  In a situation like this, a schema locating file
can define a type identifier for each variant. As with <tt>C-c
C-s</tt>, Emacs will ask whether you wish to add a rule to a schema
locating file that persistently associates the document with the
specified type identifier.</p>

<p>The command <tt>C-c C-l</tt> adds a rule to a schema
locating file that persistently associates the document with
the schema that is currently being used.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Schema locating files</h2>

<p>Each schema locating file specifies a list of rules.  The rules
from each file are appended in order. To locate a schema each rule is
applied in turn until a rule matches.  The first matching rule is then
used to determine the schema.</p>

<p>Schema locating files are designed to be useful for other
applications that need to locate a schema for a document. In fact,
there is nothing specific to locating schemas in the design; it could
equally well be used for locating a stylesheet.</p>

<section>
<h2>Schema locating file syntax basics</h2>

<p>There is a schema for schema locating files in the file
<bo>locate.rnc</bo> in the schema directory.  Schema locating
files must be valid with respect to this schema.</p>

<p>The document element of a schema locating file must be
<bo>locatingRules</bo> and the namespace URI must be
<bo>http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0</bo>.  The
children of the document element specify rules. The order of the
children is the same as the order of the rules.  Here's a complete
example of a schema locating file:

<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?>
&lt;locatingRules xmlns="http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0">
  &lt;namespace ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" uri="xhtml.rnc"/>
  &lt;documentElement localName="book" uri="docbook.rnc"/>
&lt;/locatingRules>
</pre>

This says to use the schema <bo>xhtml.rnc</bo> for a document with
namespace <bo>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</bo>, and to use the
schema <bo>docbook.rnc</bo> for a document whose local name is
<bo>book</bo>.  If the document element had both a namespace URI
of <bo>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</bo> and a local name of
<bo>book</bo>, then the matching rule that comes first will be
used and so the schema <bo>xhtml.rnc</bo> would be used.  There is
no precedence between different types of rule; the first matching rule
of any type is used.</p>

<p>As usual with XML-related technologies, resources are identified
by URIs.  The <bo>uri</bo> attribute identifies the schema by
specifying the URI.  The URI may be relative.  If so, it is resolved
relative to the URI of the schema locating file that contains
attribute. This means that if the value of <bo>uri</bo> attribute
does not contain a <bo>/</bo>, then it will refer to a filename in
the same directory as the schema locating file.<!--  The
<bo>xml:base</bo> attribute may be used to change the base URI
used for resolving relative URIs.--></p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Using the document's URI to locate a schema</h2>

<p>A <bo>uri</bo> rule locates a schema based on the URI
of the document.  The <bo>resource</bo> attribute specifies
the URI of the document. The <bo>uri</bo> attribute
specifies the URI of the schema.  For example,

<pre>
&lt;uri resource="spec.xml" uri="docbook.rnc"/>
</pre>

specifies that that the schema for <bo>spec.xml</bo> is
<bo>docbook.rnc</bo>.</p>

<p>A <bo>uri</bo> rule may use a <bo>pathSuffix</bo>
attribute instead of a <bo>resource</bo> attribute to locate a
schema based on the suffix of the URI.  It considers only the path
component of the URI. In terms of files, it is equivalent to matching
on the file extension.  For example,

<pre>
&lt;uri pathSuffix=".xsl" uri="xslt.rnc"/>
</pre>

specifies that the schema for documents whose URI ends with
<bo>.xsl</bo> is <bo>xslt.rnc</bo>.</p>

<p>A <bo>transformURI</bo> rule locates a schema by
transforming the URI of the document. The rule matches only if the
transformed URI exists.  If there is a <bo>pathSuffix</bo>
attribute, then the path component of the document's URI must end with
the specified suffix. If there is a <bo>pathAppend</bo> attribute,
then the URI is transformed by appending the specified string to the
URI's path component.  For example,

<pre>
&lt;transformURI pathAppend=".rnc"/>
</pre>

specifies that to locate a schema for a document
<bo><var>foo</var></bo>, Emacs should test whether a file
<bo><var>foo</var>.rnc</bo> exists in the same directory as
<bo><var>foo</var></bo>, and, if so, should use it as the
schema. If there is a <bo>replacePathSuffix</bo> attribute, then
the URI is transformed by replacing the suffix matched by the
<bo>pathSuffix</bo> attribute by the value of the
<bo>replacePathSuffix</bo> attribute.  A <bo>transformURI</bo>
rule matches only if the transformed URI is a valid URI that
identifies an existing resource. For example,

<pre>
&lt;transformURI pathSuffix=".xml" replacePathSuffix=".rnc"/>
</pre>

specifies that to locate a schema for a document
<bo><var>foo</var>.xml</bo>, Emacs should test whether a file
<bo><var>foo</var>.rnc</bo> exists in the same directory as
<bo><var>foo</var>.xml</bo>, and, if so, should use it as the
schema.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Using the document element to locate a schema</h2>

<p>A <bo>documentElement</bo> rule locates a schema based on
the local name and prefix of the document element. For example, a rule

<pre>
&lt;documentElement prefix="xsl" localName="stylesheet" uri="xslt.rnc"/>
</pre>

specifies that when the name of the document element is
<bo>xsl:stylesheet</bo>, then <bo>xslt.rnc</bo> should be used
as the schema. Either the <bo>prefix</bo> or
<bo>localName</bo> attribute may be omitted to allow any prefix or
local name.</p>

<p>A <bo>namespace</bo> rule locates a schema based on the
namespace URI of the document element. For example, a rule

<pre>
&lt;namespace ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" uri="xslt.rnc"/>
</pre>

specifies that when the namespace URI of the document is
<bo>http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform</bo>, then
<bo>xslt.rnc</bo> should be used as the schema.</p>

</section>

<!--
<section>
<h2>Using the DOCTYPE declaration to locate a schema</h2>

<p>A <bo>doctypePublicId</bo> rule locates a schema based on
the public identifier specified in the <bo>DOCTYPE</bo>
declaration. For example, a rule

<pre>
&lt;doctypePublicId publicId="-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
  uri="xhtml1-transitional.rnc"/>
</pre>

specifies that when the document has a <bo>DOCTYPE</bo>
declaration with a public identifier <bo>-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0
Transitional//EN</bo>, then <bo>xhtml1-transitional.rnc</bo>
should be used as the schema.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Specifying a default schema</h2>

<p>A <bo>default</bo> rule specifies a default schema. This
rule always matches.  For example,

<pre>
&lt;default uri="docbook.rnc"/>
</pre>

says to use the schema <bo>docbook.rnc</bo>.</p>

</section>
-->
<section>
<h2>Using type identifiers in schema locating files</h2>

<p>Type identifiers allow a level of indirection in locating the
schema for a document.  Instead of associating the document directly
with a schema URI, the document is associated with a type identifier,
which is in turn associated with a schema URI. nXML mode does not
constrain the format of type identifiers.  They can be simply strings
without any formal structure or they can be public identifiers or
URIs.  Note that these type identifiers have nothing to do with the
DOCTYPE declaration.  When comparing type identifiers, whitespace is
normalized in the same way as with the <bo>xsd:token</bo>
datatype: leading and trailing whitespace is stripped; other sequences
of whitespace are normalized to a single space character.</p>

<p>Each of the rules described in previous sections that uses a
<bo>uri</bo> attribute to specify a schema, can instead use a
<bo>typeId</bo> attribute to specify a type identifier.  The type
identifier can be associated with a URI using a <bo>typeId</bo>
element. For example,

<pre>
&lt;locatingRules xmlns="http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0">
  &lt;namespace ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" typeId="XHTML"/>
  &lt;typeId id="XHTML" typeId="XHTML Strict"/>
  &lt;typeId id="XHTML Strict" uri="xhtml-strict.rnc"/>
  &lt;typeId id="XHTML Transitional" uri="xhtml-transitional.rnc"/>
&lt;/locatingRules>
</pre>

declares three type identifiers <bo>XHTML</bo> (representing the
default variant of XHTML to be used), <bo>XHTML Strict</bo> and
<bo>XHTML Transitional</bo>.  Such a schema locating file would
use <bo>xhtml-strict.rnc</bo> for a document whose namespace is
<bo>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</bo>.  But it is considerably
more flexible than a schema locating file that simply specified

<pre>
&lt;namespace ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" uri="xhtml-strict.rnc"/>
</pre>

A user can easily use <tt>C-c C-t</tt> to select between XHTML
Strict and XHTML Transitional. Also, a user can easily add a catalog

<pre>
&lt;locatingRules xmlns="http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0">
  &lt;typeId id="XHTML" typeId="XHTML Transitional"/>
&lt;/locatingRules>
</pre>

that makes the default variant of XHTML be XHTML Transitional.</p>

<!--
<p>A <bo>typeIdProcessingInstruction</bo> rule allows a
document to specify its own typeId with a processing instruction.  The
<bo>target</bo> attribute specifies the processing instruction
target that should be recognized as specifying a typeId in its
value. For example, with an additional rule

<pre>
&lt;typeIdProcessingInstruction target="my-doctype"/>
</pre>

a document that started

<pre>
&lt;?my-doctype XHTML Transitional?>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</pre>

would be validated against <bo>xhtml-transitional.rnc</bo>.</p>
-->
<!--
<p>A <bo>typeIdBase</bo> rule makes it possible to avoid having
to add an explicit rule for every typeId. For example, a rule

<pre>
&lt;typeIdBase append=".rnc"/>
</pre>

occuring in a schema locating file
<bo>/home/jjc/schema/schemas.xml</bo> would make Emacs try to use
file <bo>/home/jjc/schema/DocBook.rnc</bo> for a type identifier
of <bo>DocBook</bo>; it would test whether that file existed, and
if it did, it would use it.  In terms of URIs, Emacs appends the value
of the <bo>append</bo> attribute to the typeId; it then %-escapes
all URI-significant characters; this is then treated as a relative URI
and resolved relative to the base URI applicable to the
<bo>typeIdBased</bo> element.  The typeId will be mapped to this
URI, provided that the URI identifies an existing resource.</p>
-->
</section>

<section>
<h2>Using multiple schema locating files</h2>

<p>The <bo>include</bo> element includes rules from another
schema locating file.  The behavior is exactly as if the rules from
that file were included in place of the <bo>include</bo> element.
Relative URIs are resolved into absolute URIs before the inclusion is
performed. For example,

<pre>
&lt;include rules="../rules.xml"/>
</pre>

includes the rules from <bo>rules.xml</bo>.</p>

<p>The process of locating a schema takes as input a list of schema
locating files.  The rules in all these files and in the files they
include are resolved into a single list of rules, which are applied
strictly in order.  Sometimes this order is not what is needed.
For example, suppose you have two schema locating files, a private
file

<pre>
&lt;locatingRules xmlns="http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0">
  &lt;namespace ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" uri="xhtml.rnc"/>
&lt;/locatingRules>
</pre>

followed by a public file

<pre>
&lt;locatingRules xmlns="http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0">
  &lt;transformURI pathSuffix=".xml" replacePathSuffix=".rnc"/>
  &lt;namespace ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" typeId="XSLT"/>
&lt;/locatingRules>
</pre>

The effect of these two files is that the XHTML <bo>namespace</bo>
rule takes precedence over the <bo>transformURI</bo> rule, which
is almost certainly not what is needed.  This can be solved by adding
an <bo>applyFollowingRules</bo> to the private file.

<pre>
&lt;locatingRules xmlns="http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0">
  &lt;applyFollowingRules ruleType="transformURI"/>
  &lt;namespace ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" uri="xhtml.rnc"/>
&lt;/locatingRules>
</pre>
</p>

<h2>DTDs</h2>

<p>nxml-mode is designed to support the creation of standalone XML
documents that do not depend on a DTD.  Although it is common practice
to insert a DOCTYPE declaration referencing an external DTD, this has
undesirable side-effects.  It means that the document is no longer
self-contained. It also means that different XML parsers may interpret
the document in different ways, since the XML Recommendation does not
require XML parsers to read the DTD.  With DTDs, it was impractical to
get validation without using an external DTD or reference to an
parameter entity.  With RELAX NG and other schema languages, you can
simulataneously get the benefits of validation and standalone XML
documents.  Therefore, I recommend that you do not reference an
external DOCTYPE in your XML documents.</p>

<p>One problem is entities for characters. Typically, as well as
providing validation, DTDs also provide a set of character entities
for documents to use. Schemas cannot provide this functionality,
because schema validation happens after XML parsing.  The recommended
solution is to either use the Unicode characters directly, or, if this
is impractical, use character references.  nXML mode supports this by
providing commands for entering characters and character references
using the Unicode names, and can display the glyph corresponding to a
character reference.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>nXML mode has some limitations:

<ul>
<li>
<p>DTD support is limited.  Internal parsed general entities declared
in the internal subset are supported provided they do not contain
elements. Other usage of DTDs is ignored.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The restrictions on RELAX NG schemas in section 7 of the RELAX NG
specification are not enforced.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Unicode support has problems. This stems mostly from the fact that
the XML (and RELAX NG) character model is based squarely on Unicode,
whereas the Emacs character model is not.  Emacs 22 is slated to have
full Unicode support, which should improve the situation here.</p>
</li>
</ul>
